<h1>Booleans</h1>
Booleans are either True or False. In this example, we will do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Initially the guard doesn't move, so we set a variable called guard_moved to False</li>
    <li>
        We give the player an option to run or go to the door. We will cover this in the next task.

    </li>
</ul>
